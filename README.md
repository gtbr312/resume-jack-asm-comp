# Jack Assembler and Compiler

The Jack Assembler is a program which takes in code for a simplistic virtual machine and outputs machine code intended for a 16 bit processor. The specifications for the machine code are informed by a distinct project in which I constructed a theoretical 16 bit processor in a HDL. The Jack Compiler intakes a file or repositories of files written in Jack and converts it to the Jack Virtual Machine language. These two processes run in sequence take the high level OOP language of Jack and translate it into a 16 bit machine code language.
